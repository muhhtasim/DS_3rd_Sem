# DS_3rd_Sem
Welcome to the ultimate collection of my Data Structures (3rd Semester) adventures. This is where code meets chaos, and algorithms come to life (sometimes reluctantly).

What you’ll find here:

⚡ Code that works (after 100 debug sessions).                                                                                              ⚡Code that doesn’t work (but has "character").
✨ Code that works but no one knows why (true genius 😂).
📖 Assignments that scream, “Please don’t plagiarize me!”
🤔 Algorithms that may or may not solve world hunger (but definitely solve my grades).

Feel free to poke around, fork it, or just stare at it in awe (or confusion).
Feedback is welcome—just don’t judge the comments... or lack thereof.
Contributions are welcome unless they’re smarter than mine—then we might have a problem. 😂
